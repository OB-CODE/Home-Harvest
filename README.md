Front end REACT project. First time using react with the goal of incorporating 2 external API's along with my own custome database to query.  

API
- looks at user location for Geo Location.
- Produce current weather data for user. 
- Map daily data over a 12 month period. 
- Use the yearly data to produce tables, graphs and calculate growing conditions for plants. 

### Overview of the APP

## :page_facing_up: About

- Home Harvest is designed to reduce the barriers of entry for the everyday person trying to grow produce. Decide on what you would like to grow and see when it would best suit your location. With the planner, you are able to map out a full year’s worth of crop rotations to make sure you know when to plant and harvest all the yummy things you want to grow.
- Home Harvest will fetch the yearly average temperatures for your location based on the previous year’s data.
- Once you have added your ideal crop selection, check the planter guide table for the ✅ to see when the estimated best time to sow your crop is.

## 🧰: Tech

- REACT

---

## :bug: Bugs to fix

- Back end log in - possible add on but ad this point it would not add enough purpose. 
- Spacing of CropCards - It would be nicer visually to have the different categories mix together too. 

---

## :sob: Lessons learnt

- Better understanding of REACT. In future I will work out what tools can be utilised to help with the project - EG the REACT tables look far nicer with more utility than the vanilla HTML used.

## :white_check_mark: Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this

- Soil temperature readings. 
- Historical data over longer periods for better averages. 
- Graph showing the harvest times based on the estimations in each card.
